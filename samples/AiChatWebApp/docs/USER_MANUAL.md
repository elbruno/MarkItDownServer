## Tips and Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Upload Quality Documents**: Clear, well-formatted documents work best
2. **Descriptive Filenames**: Use meaningful names for your documents
3. **Start Specific**: Begin with specific questions before asking for summaries
4. **Verify Citations**: Always check the cited sources to verify information
5. **One Topic Per Upload**: Group related documents together

### Document Preparation

- **PDFs**: Ensure text is selectable (not scanned images without OCR)
- **Word Docs**: Keep formatting simple; complex layouts may not convert well
- **Excel**: Works best with tabular data; formulas are not executed
- **PowerPoint**: Bullet points and text are extracted; images are not processed

### Query Strategies

- **Start Broad**: "What topics are covered in this document?"
- **Then Specific**: "What is the warranty period for the GPS watch?"
- **Compare**: "What are the differences between the two health plans?"
- **Summarize**: "Summarize the key benefits in the emergency kit guide"
